# 🌐 Medly: The Future of Secure Healthcare Records in Indonesia

---

## 🩺 Overview :

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are digital systems that replace traditional paper charts by storing patients’ medical histories, diagnoses, medications, and treatments.  
However, in Indonesia, these systems often exist in isolated, centralized silos, making it difficult for healthcare providers to access comprehensive patient data across multiple hospitals—slowing down care and compromising accuracy.  
**Medly** offers a breakthrough by leveraging the **Internet Computer (ICP)** blockchain to decentralize EMR storage.  
Each registered hospital links directly to tamper-proof patient records, creating a secure and interoperable ecosystem where medical data can be safely shared and verified.  
Doctors gain instant access to complete patient histories, improving decision-making and care quality, while patients enjoy transparency and full ownership of their data.  
By bridging technology with patient-centered care, Medly ensures improved healthcare outcomes while aligning with local health regulations.


## ⚙️ Features :

- 🏥 **Hospital & Doctor Management** – Register, manage, or deactivate hospitals and doctors  
- 📋 **Medical Records** – Add and access patient records securely  
- 🔎 **Data Retrieval** – View hospitals, doctors, and patient records easily


## 🔄 How It Works

- 🏥 **Hospital Registration** – Hospitals register with basic info and are managed by the owner’s wallet  
- 👨‍⚕️ **Doctor Management** – Hospitals add or deactivate doctors tied to their institution  
- 📋 **Medical Records** – Doctors add diagnoses and supporting data linked to patient ID  
- 🔎 **Data Access** – Users can retrieve active hospitals, doctors, and patient-specific records

## 🩺 Project Overview  

**Medly** is a decentralized Electronic Medical Records (EMR) platform that replaces traditional paper charts with secure, blockchain-based storage. Around the world, many EMR systems remain isolated and centralized, making it difficult for healthcare providers to access complete patient histories across different hospitals or even across borders. This leads to slower treatment, higher risk of errors, and limited quality of care for patients.

By leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, Medly creates a tamper-proof, interoperable ecosystem for medical data. Hospitals can securely share and verify patient records, doctors gain instant access to accurate histories, and patients have full ownership of their health information — ensuring transparency, speed, and trust in every step of care.

### 🎯 Mission
To make healthcare data **secure, transparent, and universally accessible** while giving **patients control** over their records.

---

## 🚨 Problem  

Current EMR systems suffer from:  
- **Centralization risks** → Data breaches & downtime  
- **Lack of interoperability** → Fragmented medical records  
- **Limited patient control** → Patients can’t fully manage their data  
- **Security vulnerabilities** → Sensitive medical data often unprotected  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  

Medly ensures:  
- **Decentralized Architecture** → No single point of failure  
- **Secure Record Management** → Encrypted data on IPFS, hashes on ICP blockchain  
- **Easy Onboarding** → Hospitals register, mint doctors, doctors upload records  
- **Patient Transparency** → Full access logs & control over permissions  

---

## 🏗️ Core Workflow  

1. **Hospital Registration** → Hospital creates account & accesses Dashboard  
2. **Mint Doctor** → Hospital generates Doctor accounts automatically  
3. **Doctor Login** → Doctor logs in & accesses Doctor Dashboard  
4. **Upload Records** → Doctors upload encrypted medical records
